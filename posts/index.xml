      <description>Today is the third last day of my 27. Frankly I had a very disappinting year of being 27, surviving more than living. Barely think, barely learn, take things for granted, day after day of lossing control of my life.
I am glad it is almost done, 28 will be different, I promise.</description>

      <guid>http://ymsfd.github.io/posts/setup-ssh-keys-for-multiple-github-accounts/</guid>
      <description>The problem of managing multiple GitHub accounts came when I have a personal github account for collecting various study resource or my side projects, and I do not want to use this personal account for working in a GitHub organization. Also, every push with identity and password is quite annoying for me. So I set up different SSH keys to easily manage multiple accounts.
step 1: go to .ssh folder and generate ssh keys for all your github accounts    cd ~/.</description>

      <description>Textual similarity calculation is an important NLP tasks with a lot of application, for example, search engine, question answering system. Generally this tasks can be decomposed into three subtasks:
 Text cleaning Vector representation Distance metrics  Text Cleaning    Text cleaning typically includes:
 lower case all words reomve special symbols (remove digit) remove stopwords (customize stopwords) stemming/lemme &amp;hellip;  import re import nltk from nltk.corpus import stopwords def clean(text): lowered = [i.</description>

      <description>Willpower and pressure are enemy. I am afraid of things to comes in the future, and I tend to over-worry about the consequences brought by a tiny bit case. I guess I am one part of the so-called HSP group. I do have a strong willpower, at least I had it before, otherwise I could not make the multiple marathons in the past. But where are they now? I am burried in the invisible pressure day by day, night by night.</description>

      <title>Dimension varying when loading pretrained model</title>

      <description> seq2seq model, load data with torchtext Field, TabularData.. when loading the saved model got the error of varying dimension inside of layer. The total vocabulary size is changing everytime by loading. stuck reason: thought it is the model problem or data been randomly shufftled when loading real problem: data is saved in .csv file, and inside of data there are also commas, therefore, the data is incorrectly read.  </description>

      <title>more thinking and writing</title>

      <description>I realized I could not write anymore, I read too much and too fast that I did not leave time for thinking. This is a disaster for my brain, and for my till now still not finished report which supposed to be finished one year ago. Because I forgot how to write, how to output thoughts, and the longer the delay, the more my brain refuse to think, refuse to start from any single tiny step.</description>
